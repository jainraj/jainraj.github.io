Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are probabilistic graphical models which use neural networks to approximate latent posteriors.
We try to make posterior as close to a fixed prior while trying to maximise the information it can transmit about the data point. 
The encoder takes the datapoint and maps to a latent and decoder takes the latent and reconstructs the datapoint. 

Here, I implement VAEs on the dSprites and CelebA datasets.
All code and results are in my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/jainraj/ADRL-Course-Codes/tree/master/VAE">
