As part of the course project, I chose predicting the inference between two sentences using the Stanford Natural Language
Inference Dataset by building machine learning models. All the steps like pre-processing, architecture design, hyper-parameter
tuning were performed for two types of models:

<ol>
<li>Logistic Regression using TF-IDF features in Scikit library</li>
<li>Recurrent neural network in PyTorch framework</li>
</ol>

All code and results present in my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/jainraj/Machine-Learning-Course-Work"><i class="fab fa-github gh-icon"></i></a>. 

I obtained an accuracy of <b>80.49%</b>.  Yay!
