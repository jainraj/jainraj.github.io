Curriculum Induction for Safe Reinforcement learning (CISR) is a safe RL approach in which an artificial teacher helps an 
agent (student) learn potentially dangerous skills by inducing a sequence of safety-ensuring training stages called curriculum. 
This was proposed by Turchetta et al. in NeurIPS 2020 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12136">[1]</a>.

As part of the course project, I extended the framework provided by the authors for different environments. All code and 
results present in my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/jainraj/CISR_NeurIPS20/tree/rlproject"><i class="fab fa-github gh-icon"></i></a>.
