As part of one assignment, I chose to work on <b>visualising GitHub
messages</b> of various famous repositories. It involved working with text data for the first time in detail and
coming up with good visualisations which helped to infer certain relations. All the code can be seen in
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rajjain/github-messages-dataset-visualisation">my Visualize Github Messages Kaggle Notebook</a>. 

As part of the course project, I chose to work on <b>predicting the MBTI personality of a person</b>
based on the text written by the person. I chose TPUs as my processing unit as it gave me about 70x improvement in
speed. All code is in the following Kaggle notebooks:
