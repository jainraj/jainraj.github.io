Explored the possibility of combining Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) and Steady State
Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP) Brain Computer Interface (BCI) paradigms as an efficient mode of
communication for paralysed people i.e., Concurrent Multi-Output Visio-Auditory (CMOVA) BCI

Implemented various neuroscience related feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms
in MATLAB

Studied and compared the offline accuracies of different feature extraction and machine learning algorithms

Led the team and coordinated with the voluntary subjects throughout the project
