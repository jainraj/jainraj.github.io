We use the open <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00870-6">Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC)</a> 
dataset to explore Machine Learning algorithms with different predictors and outcome variables. We explored how MRI 
data, anatomical data could predict audio features. This gave us the chance to explore libraries like nibabel and 
sklearn.

Overall it was a great experience to connect with people interested in the intersection of neuroscience and machine 
learning. The lectures were very good and informative of the issues plaguing these fields -
