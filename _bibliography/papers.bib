    abstract={Machine learning (ML) is the field that adds intelligence to devices providing them with capabilities to process and identify patterns in data just like human beings do. Programming devices in this manner can help in identifying those patterns which human beings often cannot. Machine learning is based on modelling data mathematically. ML has been gaining a lot of attention in the last few decades, especially in fields of interdisciplinary research. Brain--Computer Interface (BCI) is an area where Machine Learning Technology is been rapidly using. Also, Machine Learning techniques have to be used so that one can get a better result and more efficiency. Information Transfer Rate is the best way to measure the performance of the signals. The current research is mainly focused on achieving the systems with higher ITR. The focus of the proposed system is to get better and high Information Transfer Rate by merging two different approaches. The approach used in this work is (SSVEP), Visually Evoked Potential and (SSAEP) Auditory Evoked Potential by using Hidden Markova Model (HMM). The system which is to be developed checks whether the existing system has such facility if it has, does it provides accuracy which is of a higher rate and can put it in the real-world applications.},

    abstract={Brain computer interface (BCI) is a method of communication between the brain and computer or machines, which use the neural activity of the brain. This neural activity communication does not occur using the peripheral nervous system and muscles, as is the usual case in human beings, but through any other mechanism. This paper focuses on different types of feature extraction techniques to explore a new kind of BCI paradigm and validate whether it can give a better ITR as compared to the existing paradigms.},

    abstract={Communication that exists between Human Brain and Computer is termed as Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This uses neuronal activity of the brain. Information is passed from one part of the body to another through the neurons present in the human brain. This paper focuses on different types of classification algorithm to explore a new kind of BCI paradigm. This also focuses on the Information Transfer Rate of the existing paradigms and also compares our paradigm with the existing paradigms.},
