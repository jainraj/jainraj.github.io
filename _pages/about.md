<h4> Hello World! </h4>

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from RV College of Engineering in 2016. In the last semester, my 
team and I worked on creating a <b>new BCI paradigm</b>, by collecting and filtering data from enthusiastic subjects and building
ML models for prediction. This gave me hands-on experience in <b>applying AI algorithms to neural data</b>. Additionally, this 
also acquainted me with neuroscience concepts like EEG, SSVEP and <b>how to build and validate hypotheses and experiments</b>. 
I was hooked! I knew I had to pursue this further! After working as a Data Scientist and Software Developer for about 4 years, I joined IISc to do my PhD.

I am the recipient of the prestigious <a href="https://www.pmrf.in/">Prime Minister's Research Fellowship</a> in Jan 2022.

<h4> Research Interests </h4>

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and Neuroscience, in two ways. One is to build AI models which can 
deepen our understanding of cognitive processed like decision-making and attention. The other is to use neuroscience to 
build more robust, efficient, explainable and realistic AI models.  

<h4> Current Research Work </h4>

My current work is to understand if deep neural networks can <b>predict behavior</b> (choice, reaction times) better than simple 
statistical models. More precisely, do <b>deep recurrent neural networks (e.g., LSTMs)</b> model sequential effects better than 
conventional statistical learning models? Additionally, whether <b>low-dimensional subject and experiment embeddings</b> can 
capture aspects of behavior that are unique to subjects or experimental manipulations respectively? Lastly, does adding 
<b>neural signals </b> to deep learning models better their predictive power?
