<h4> Hello World! </h4>

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from RV College of Engineering in 2016. In the last semester, my 
team and I worked on creating a <b>new BCI paradigm</b>, by collecting and filtering data from enthusiastic subjects and building
ML models for prediction. This gave me hands-on experience in <b>applying AI algorithms to neural data</b>. Additionally, this 
also acquainted me with neuroscience concepts like EEG, SSVEP and <b>how to build and validate hypotheses and experiments</b>. 
I was hooked! I knew I had to pursue this further! After working as a Data Scientist and Software Developer for about 4 years, I joined IISc to do my PhD.

I am the recipient of the prestigious <a href="https://www.pmrf.in/">Prime Minister's Research Fellowship</a> in Jan 2022.

<h4> Research Interests </h4>

Intersection of AI and Neuroscience:

<ul>
  <li>Build AI models which can  deepen our <b>understanding of cognitive processes</b> like decision-making and attention </li>
  <li>Use neuroscience to <b>build more robust, efficient, explainable and realistic AI models</b></li>
</ul>

<h4> Current Research </h4>

<ol>
    <li>Can deep recurrent networks <b>predict sequential behaviour better</b> than statistical models?</li>
    <li>Can embedding layers capture inter-participant and inter-experiment <b>variabilities</b>?</li>
    <li>Can <b>AI explainability tools</b> be used to understand brain-behavior relationships?</li>
    <li>Does <b>adding neural signals</b> help predict behavior better? If yes, what are the features the model is using? Can 
        we generate new testable hypotheses?</li>
</ol>
