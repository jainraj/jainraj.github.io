<h3><b>Motivation</b></h3>
In this self-designed slow-paced course, I teach Generative Modeling from the fundamentals. The focus is on building 
ideas from the ground up which help understanding the concepts in greater detail and alleviate any fear in reading new papers
of the field! 

<h3><b>Course Design & Content</b></h3>
I designed and executed the course under the <a href="https://isssonline.in/pmrf-student-lecture-series/">
PMRF Student Lecture Series scheme of ISSS</a>, which provides a platform to connect with interested students. 
The <a href="https://isssonline.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PMRF_ISSSflyer-Generative-Modelling-using-VAEs.pdf">Course Flyer</a> had the 
schedule and the planned course content. All the lectures were held online in Microsoft Teams which allowed anyone around the 
world to attend and easy recording capabilities. Every lecture was for <b>two hours</b>. 

I discuss basics of probability and motivate ideas like **KL divergence**. This builds the foundation for going through the 
**VAE formulation**. I discuss concepts like **Multivariate Gaussians** and their properties to get a clearer understanding of VAEs. 
I then talk about some **issues in VAEs** and some solutions explored in the literature. After a quick **overview of GANs**, 
I discuss **diffusion models** from the ground up. Lastly, I motivate the intuition behind **energy-based models** and 
other generative models. 

All the lectures were recorded and uploaded in 
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLklrrPL2ypmaJnO-7I57rosc20abD68dM">
Generative Modeling playlist</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@therajvjainteaching">my YouTube 
teaching channel</a>.
