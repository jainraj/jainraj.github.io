<h3><b>TA Duties</b></h3>
As part of NPTEL PMRF TA scheme, I got the opportunity to serve as a TA for the 
<a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/nptel-courses/intro-to-machine-learning/">Introduction to Machine Learning</a> course 
taught by <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/">Dr. Balaraman Ravindran</a>. As part of the TA duties, we would have 
<b>one hour</b> sessions with the students every week <b>(total of 12 weeks)</b> in which we could either teach a new 
concept or clarify students' doubts. I would generally ask the students in the chat forum if they wanted any specific 
doubts clarified a day before my session. I would either solve those questions or teach a related concept not covered by 
the professor that week or teach a concept in more detail than covered by the professor. We were required to record the 
lectures and upload it on YouTube so that students who could not make it to the session could watch later. 

<h3><b>Experience</b></h3>
TAing for this course made the "When one teaches, two learn" quote true for me! ML field is challenging at best and TAing 
for this course helped me get back into touch with the basics. Handling diverse doubts from students
helped me also learn and strengthen my concepts. Since it was live and interactive, I had to think on
the spot and even have the humility to say that I don't know something when I don't know it and came back with answers 
with rigorous arguments. 

<h3><b>Teaching Content</b></h3>

            We solved Linear Algebra and Probability problems from Intro to ML NPTEL Course practice problems. We touch 
            upon concepts like Bayes' theorem, conditional probability, Eigen values and vectors, joint probability 
            distributions. Lastly, we brainstorm ideas on building an ML system for predicting weather!
