<h3><b>TA Duties</b></h3>
As part of NPTEL PMRF TA scheme, I got the opportunity to serve as a TA for the 
<a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc23_cs87/preview">Introduction to Machine Learning</a> course 
taught by <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sudeshna/">Dr. Sudeshna Sarkar</a>. As part of the TA duties, we would have 
<b>two hour</b> sessions with the students every week <b>(total of 9 weeks)</b> in which we could either teach a new 
concept or clarify students' doubts. I would generally ask the students in the chat forum if they wanted any specific 
doubts clarified a day before my session. I would either solve those questions or teach a related concept not covered by 
the professor that week or teach a concept in more detail than covered by the professor. We were required to record the 
lectures and upload it on YouTube so that students who could not make it to the session could watch later.
