title: Increasing neuroscience literacy in undergraduate students 
description: Majority of undergraduate students are not aware of neuroscience as a field - what is required to 
  enter this field, what are the research avenues, what are the potential jobs, etc. Given the infancy
  of the field, there is opportunity for several full-time Einsteins and Newtons. Hence, the 
  PMRF fellows of CNS, IISc get together to give an overview of the exciting field of neuroscience (and our research) 
  to the undergraduate students across India.
